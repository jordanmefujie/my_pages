        <p>To answer this question, I will proceed to break 
            down the URL; <i>https://www.google.com.</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>https://</i> is a scheme, it is a Secure 
                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</li>
                    <li>
                        <i>www</i> is a subdomain to <i>google.com</i> domain, it works like an 
                        identifier or an address to the website that points to a specific 
                        server IP address serving the website.
                    </li>
            </ul>

    <p>
        When you type <i>"https://www.google.com"</i> 
        into your browser's address bar and hit <strong>Enter</strong>, 
        you kick off a fascinating sequence of events 
        that make the internet seem like magic. 
        Let's delve into the intricate process that takes 
        place behind the scenes, involving DNS requests, 
        TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, 
        web servers, application servers, and databases. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>DNS Request:</h3>
    <p>
        When a user types in the URL and presses enter, 
        the journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) 
        request, your browser first needs to figure out or 
        resolves the IP address that the computer understands 
        of the server hosting the website. 
        It does this by performing a DNS query 
        (also known as DNS request) where the user's 
        computer (DNS client) asks for the IP address 
        associated with the domain name from a 
        DNS server (a computer server that contains a 
        database of public IP addresses 
        and their associated hostnames).
    </p><img src="DNS.png" alt="browser query for IP address" class="border">
    <br><br>
    <h3>TCP/IP:</h3>
    <p>
        Once the IP address is obtained, 
        a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
        Protocol (TCP/IP) connection is established. 
        This communication protocol ensures reliable and 
        ordered delivery of data between your 
        computer and <strong>Google's</strong> servers.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Firewall:</h3>
    <p>
        Before your request reaches <strong>Google's</strong> servers, 
        it encounters firewalls, which act as 
        gatekeepers. Firewalls monitor and control 
        incoming and outgoing network traffic, ensuring 
        that only authorized data passes through. 
        This security layer protects against unauthorized 
        access 
        and potential threats.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>HTTPS/SSL:</h3>
    <p>
        The data exchange between your browser 
        and <strong>Google</strong> is secured through the use of 
        HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) 
        and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. 
        This encryption safeguards the information 
        exchanged from eavesdroppers and ensures 
        the integrity and authenticity of 
        the communication.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Load Balancer:</h3>
    <p>
        Large-scale websites like <strong>Google </strong>
        often use load balancers to distribute 
        incoming network traffic across multiple 
        servers. This ensures optimal resource 
        utilization, prevents server overload, 
        and enhances the website's performance. 
        Load balancers contribute to a seamless user 
        experience by efficiently
         managing the incoming requests.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Web Server:</h3>
    <p>
        Upon passing through the load balancer, 
        your request reaches a web server. 
        Web servers, like Apache or Nginx, 
        handle incoming requests, process them, 
        nd generate responses. In <strong>Google's</strong> case, 
        the web server might 
        return the search page you requested.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Application Server:</h3>
    <p>
        For more dynamic content or services, 
        the web server may communicate with an 
        application server. Application servers, 
        such as those running Java or PHP, execute 
        specific tasks or processes requested by the user. 
        In <strong>Google's</strong> scenario, this could involve complex 
        search algorithms or personalized content generation.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Database:</h3>
    <p>
        For data retrieval and storage, 
        the application server may interact with a 
        database. <strong>Google's</strong> vast databases store indexed 
        information, and queries from the application 
        server retrieve the 
        relevant data to fulfill your search request.
